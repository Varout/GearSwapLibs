# GearSwap Libs for FFXI by Varout (Varrout on Phoenix)

My personal GearSwap libs. A lot are out of date and are in the process of being re-written

Most luas have the ability to lock in certain rings to make sure they aren't unequipped when casting spells or buffs wear off.
e.g. You've just finished an event, your buffs are on cooldown and you've got a Warp Ring on, as a buff wears off there is a check to see if you have a Warp Ring equipped and if so, it is locked in place until manually unequipped.

Some luas have the ability to lock in certain modes:

**Dynamis Mode:**
- Locks in your neck piece so that you get kill points for dynamis neck pieces.
- Shortcut: `Windows Key + X`

**Capacity Points Mode:**
- Locks in your back piece so that you're always getting the CP bonus from your cape.
- Shortcut: `Windows Key + C`

**Debug Mode:**
- Shows various bits of debug which can be useful for checking areas, spells & abilities used, weather & day, etc
- Shortcut: `Windows Key + Z`

## Varrout (Varout on Titan)

The character I've been playing on and off since 2004.  Mains are White Mage and Dragoon.

### White Mage (WHM)<sup>***</sup>

My main.  Finally got around to re-writing this lua.

#### Custom GearSwap Commands
- `gs c rr#` : Where # is the number of the reraise you want to cast.  Accepts values from 1-4.  Will be cancelled if you already have reraise up.
- `gs c r#` : Where # is the number of the raise you want to cast.  Accepts values from 1-4, where 4 will case Arise.

### Dragoon (DRG)

The lua is not originally my own work.  I plan on re-writing this.  Pretty much the main reason I started playing FFXI.

### Scholar (SCH)<sup>***</sup>

Needs a bit of work.  I have learnt a lot from re-doing my WHM lua.  Will probably re-write at some point.

### Red Mage (RDM)

A mix of my own work and someone else's.  Needs to be re-written.

### Summoner (SMN)

Not orginally my own work.  I plan on re-writing this.  Very out of date.

#### Custom GearSwap Commands
- `gs c siphon` : Picks out the most appropriate elemental spirit to summon to use for Elemental Siphon


## Manhoso

### Rune Fencer (RUN)

My own work.  Slowly upgrading my equipment.  Most is still i109 for the AF/Relic/Emp armour.  Pretty basic.  Nothing to track runes as I prefer to do this as I play.  I've seen some pretty neat stuff out there though.

### Corsair (COR)

Not originally my own work.  I plan on re-writing this.  There's a lot going on in here and I feel for me, it can be simplified a lot.

### Geomancer (GEO)
